# Docker – Core Concepts

Docker is a containerization platform that allows applications
to be packaged together with all required dependencies and
run consistently across environments.

## Why Docker?
As an Operational Engineer, I am learning Docker to:
- Eliminate "works on my machine" problems
- Standardize deployments
- Support CI/CD pipelines
- Prepare for Kubernetes and AIOps

## Key Docker Concepts

### Image
A Docker image is a lightweight, immutable template that
contains the application code, runtime, libraries, and
dependencies.

### Container
A container is a running instance of a Docker image.
Containers are isolated, lightweight, and fast to start.

### Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a text file that defines how a Docker image
is built.

### Docker Engine
Docker Engine is the core service that builds and runs
containers.

### Image vs Container
- Image → Blueprint
- Container → Running application

## Learning Approach
This repository starts from Docker fundamentals and
gradually progresses toward DevOps and AIOps concepts.
