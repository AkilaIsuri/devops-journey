##Why Kubernetes Services are needed

In Kubernetes, applications run inside Pods.
However, Pods are ephemeral:

They can be recreated

Their IP addresses can change

Multiple Pods can exist for the same application

Because of this, directly communicating with Pods is unreliable.

Kubernetes Services provide a stable and reliable way to expose and access Pods.
